# Competitive and Algorithmic Programming Code Database [bholagabbar]

My complete Competitive/Algorithmic Programming Code Database in one place. The name of the repository is a bit misleading but my primary use of Algorithmic programming so far has been CP so..

This repository contains all the source code I have written till date for algorithmic programming problems, data-structures and implementations and solutions to various Online Judge Problems such as CodeChef, SPOJ, CodeForces nd the like. My handle on all of these platforms is [bholagabbar]

The organization of files is slightly indirect as there is a lot of navigation invlolved. This is because i git-push directly from my IDE (IDEA) and the files are arranged in such a way. Anyways, here are some of the locations for relevant code:

1. JAVA Code Database: https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/src
[This folder contains folders CODECHEF, CODEFORCES, TOPCODER, SPOJ, DATASTRUCTURES and MISC. Solutions of problems solved by me on the relevant platform all al in here]

2. C++ Code Database: https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/Coding%20Workspace/C%2B%2B%20Files
[The same as above. Problems are categorized as above. I also have decent implementations of standard algos and DS in the DS_ALGO folder. Do check them out. Also, I a lot of my codes are C++14 centric]

3. Python Scripts:https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/Coding%20Workspace/Python%20Scripts
[This contains scripts i made when i was learning Python. Solutions to a few SPOJ and CodeChef problems are also there. All of them are in Python 3]

4. College Stuff: https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/Coding%20Workspace/College%20stuff
[This contains implementations of OOPS concepts and DS-ALGO course in my college. Pretty decent for an elementary level implementation of stacks, queues, linked-list and more. All of these are in C++]

5. Coursera Stanford Algorithms Course: https://github.com/bholagabbar/competitive-programming/tree/master/CODE/Coding%20Workspace/COURSERA_ALGOS1
[I also have implementations of programming questions asked and datastructures taught in the Coursera Algorithms course by Tim RoughGarden. Tried to make them as efficient as possible]

And finally a lot of mostly self explanatory miscellaneous stuff. 

If you're looking for scourging for some solutions to problems you could not solve or are looking for some correct and fairly efficent DS/ALGOS implementation, do consider checking my repository out. 

Thanks and contribute to any bugs you find, though that's unlikely :P
