# Programming Database

#####This repository contains all the source code I have written till date (and will continue to do so) for algorithmic programming problems (on various platforms like CodeChef, SPOJ and CodeForces), Implementation of Data-Structures & Algorithms as well as bunch of other stuff.

The primary aim of this repository is to act as a backup for all my source code if lost and also be of help to someone looking for algorithmic implementations/solutions to certain OJ problems for reference.  My handle on all of these platforms is **bholagabbar**

1. [JAVA Code Database](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/src): This folder contains folders CODECHEF, CODEFORCES, TOPCODER, SPOJ, DATASTRUCTURES and MISC. Solutions of problems solved by me on the relevant platform all al in here

2. [C++ Code Database](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/C%2B%2B%20Files): Solutions to Online Judge problems. I also have a good implementation of Programming Contest centric Algorithms and Datastructures [here](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/C%2B%2B%20Files/DS_ALGO)

3. [Elementary Algorithms and DS](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/College%20stuff/CSE%20220%20%28DSA%29):This contains implementations of OOPS concepts and DS-ALGO course in my college. Pretty decent for an elementary-intermediate level implementation of stacks, queues, linked-list and more. All of these are in C++. The ['College Stuff'](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/College%20stuff/CSE%20220%20%28DSA%29) folder also contains code with usage of advanced level C++ OOPS concepts [here](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/College%20stuff/CSE%20220%20%28DSA%29)

4. [Coursera Stanford Algorithms 1 Course](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/Coursera_Algo1):I also have implementations of programming questions asked and datastructures taught in the [Coursera Algorithms 1 course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo1) by Tim RoughGarden. Tried to make them as efficient as possible]

And finally a lot of mostly self explanatory miscellaneous stuff. 

As mentioned before, if you're scourging for some solutions to problems you could not solve or are looking for some correct and fairly efficent DS/ALGOS implementation, do consider checking my repository out. 

Thanks and help me fix a bug incase you stumble upon this repository and find one :)
