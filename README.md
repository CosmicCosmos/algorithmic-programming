# Algorithmic and Competitive Programming Codebase

####This repository contains all the source code I have written till date (and will continue to do so) for algorithmic programming problems (on various platforms like CodeChef, SPOJ and CodeForces), Implementation of Data-Structures & Algorithms as well as bunch of other stuff.


The primary aim of this repository is to act as a backup for all my source code if lost and also be of help to someone looking for algorithmic implementations/solutions to certain OJ problems for reference.  My handle on all of these platforms is **bholagabbar**

*<b>Fun fact</b>: This repository contains my optimized implementation of [Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) which was [posted on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-simple-efficient-C++-code-for-Dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm/answer/Shreyans-Sheth-1) and has had <b>30k+ views and lots of forks</b> on [Ideone](http://ideone.com/qkmt31) (and plenty of 'Ctrl+C's and 'Ctrl+V's :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/bholagabbar/algorithmic-programming/blob/master/Code/WorkspaceB/C++%20Files/DS_ALGO/GRAPH%20ALGOS/DIJKSTRA/DIJKSTRA_USE.cpp)*

1. **Algorithms and DS**: I have a good **Implementation of Programming Contest centric Algorithms and Datastructures** [**HERE**](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/C%2B%2B%20Files/DS_ALGO). I also have implementations of OOPS concepts and DS-ALGO for College Level Courses [here](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/College%20stuff/CSE%20220%20%28DSA%29). Pretty decent for an elementary-intermediate level implementation of stacks, queues, linked-list and more. All of these are in C++. The ['College Stuff'](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/College%20stuff) folder also contains code with usage of advanced level C++ OOPS concepts [here](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/College%20stuff/CSE%20219%28OOPS%29)

2. [JAVA Codebase](https://github.com/bholagabbar/algorithmic-programming/tree/master/Code/src): This folder contains folders CODECHEF, CODEFORCES, TOPCODER, SPOJ, DATASTRUCTURES and MISC. Solutions of nearly all problems solved by me on the relevant platforms are in here.

3. [C++ Codebase](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/C%2B%2B%20Files): Solutions to Online Judge problems.

4. [Coursera](https://github.com/bholagabbar/CP-algorithmic-programming-database/tree/master/Code/WorkspaceB/Coursera_Algo1): I also have implementations of programming questions asked and datastructures taught in the [Algorithms Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo1) by Tim RoughGarden from Stanford University. Tried to make them as efficient as possible.

5. [Interview Questions](https://github.com/bholagabbar/algorithmic-programming/tree/master/Code/src/INTERVIEW): These contain all my solutions to the questions I have solved on [InterviewBit](www.interviewbit.com) and [LeetCode](www.leetcode.com) which have been optimized and can act as a good source of reference.

And finally a lot of mostly self explanatory miscellaneous stuff. 

As mentioned before, if you're scourging for some solutions to problems you could not solve or are looking for some correct and fairly efficent DS/ALGOS implementation, do consider checking my repository out. 

Thanks and help me fix a bug incase you stumble upon this repository and find one :smile:
